# Warehouse_Getaway

Team project which was developed during a university course to 
learn Python and PyGame when still being in secondary school.

All the instructions are available in the game and all you have 
to do is to run the main.py file!

It is a game about a guy who needs to escape the warehouse which 
is full of obstacles. There is a timer as well to compete 
against your friends. You may encounter even a evil bot so be 
aware. Game was made in 2017-2018.

Enjoy!
